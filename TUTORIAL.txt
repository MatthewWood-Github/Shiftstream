TUTORIAL

NOTE: To enjoy the full experience of the game I recommend that
you play this game with a controller.

This is because I have not yet implemented analogue keyboard
support resulting in inputs feeling delayed.

In the future this file will be replaced by an in-game tutorial.

========== Drifting ===========

Drifting allows you to gain large and sustained bursts of speed.

This is a key feature in order to gain an advantage.

1) To start a drift hold the right bumper down.

2) With the right bumper held down, if you move the left stick
   left or right you build charge.
   The more to the left or right the stick is, the faster the 
   charge builds.
   
3) Charge is gained in two stages indicated by the bar in the center
   of the screen. For each bar of charge the drift lasts longer.
   
   The amount of charge also is shown by the colour of the sparks
   coming from the wheels during a drift.

4) To release a drift, let go of the right bumper whilst having
   at least one bar of charge.

5) The drift can be cancelled without gaining speed if you break enough.

TIP: drifts can be charged on any section of road. I recommend doing them
     as often as possible and heavily on straight sections.
