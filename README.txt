SHIFTSTREAM Version 1.0a
Author: https://github.com/MatthewWood-Github

========== Description ===========

This project is a Mario Kart inspired 3D racing game.

========== Motivation ===========

The Mario Kart franchise has always had a special place
in my heart and still ranks as some of my favourite games.

I had noticed that there are few experiences that deliver
the same feel and gameplay of the franchise available on
the PC and have always wanted to create a Kart racing game.

A main theme that I wanted to capture was reusable components.

For example, the results screen and spectator system.

Another main focus of the project was to create most of the
assets myself including the source code, models and music.

Quality of life has and will be another important goal.

======== Package Contents =========

.Shiftstream.exe file
.Shiftstream source code files	
.Game blender models
.Soundtrack including:
	1-Deadline.mp3 => Main race theme
	2-Victory.mp3 => Crossing finish line
	3-Conclusion.mp3 => Results screen
	Engine-Sound-1.mp3 => Default car engine sound

Note: Audio is not currently implemented.

========== Game Contents ===========

The game currently consists of a time trial mode where you
compete against the clock to achieve the best race time
across three laps.

The game currently has one available track featuring
many offroad shortcuts and room to explore.

Your result is stored until you close the game.

The game contains a computer controlled opponent which
currently is used as a showcase for my AI algorithm.

You may spectate this opponent during the race.
(see TUTORIAL.txt)

A pause and main menu exists which allows you to customise
the colour of your HUD. You can also choose whether to
display the drift indicator.
